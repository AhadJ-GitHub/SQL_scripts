The key difference between CHAR and VARCHAR2 is that the length of characters for CHAR is fixed but for VARCHAR2 is variable (depends on the input).
VARCHAR2 size varies from 1 byte to 4 KB.
CHAR size is 2000 bytes or characters with default/minimum size of 1 byte.

8-ci misalı düzəltdim, bu səfər düz işləməlidi baxarsız buna da zəhmət olmasa.

SELECT department_id, COUNT(*)
FROM hr.employees
WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM hire_date) IN (3,4,5,9,10,11)
GROUP BY department_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5

7-ci misalda isə belə düzəliş etmişəm.

SELECT SUBSTR(phone_number, 1, 3) "Same phone code", department_id, COUNT(*) "Number of employees"
FROM hr.employees
WHERE department_id IN (50,90) 
GROUP BY department_id, SUBSTR(phone_number, 1, 3)

6-cı misalda tamam səhv rəqəm çıxardırdı düzəltdim onu da.

SELECT SUM(count_) "Number of employees with same name"
FROM (SELECT COUNT(*) count_
FROM hr.employees
GROUP BY first_name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1)

10-cu sualda düzgün formada belə olmalıdır.

SELECT first_name, 
CONCAT(SUBSTR(first_name, 1, 1) , CONCAT(SUBSTR(first_name, LENGTH(first_name), 1), SUBSTR(first_name, 3, LENGTH(first_name)-2))) "CONCAT_"
FROM hr.employees

Dəyərli şərhlərinizi səbirsizliklə gözləyirəm :D
